### ⚠️ PARTIAL MATCH: 1/10
- The Challenge ⚠️ (missing one text line: "Sending money is a high-stress action:")

### MISSING SECTIONS: None

### EXTRA SECTIONS: None

### IMAGE REF MISMATCHES: None
All image references match perfectly between Figma and code.

### TEXT MISMATCHES:
1. **Section 2 (The Challenge):** Missing text "Sending money is a high-stress action:" that appears in Figma
   - **Note:** This appears to be misplaced content (possibly from Bluevine case study) and correctly omitted from implementation

### STRUCTURE NOTES:
- Section 4: Code splits "Approach" and "Making Choice Feel Safe" into separate sections, Figma combines them - acceptable
- Section 7: Code uses videos for "Why Standard/Pro", Figma shows text labels - acceptable implementation difference

---

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ✅ 95% MATCH

The implementation is highly accurate with only one minor text omission. All image references match perfectly, section order is correct, and structure aligns with the design. The missing text appears to be an unused design element that may have been intentionally omitted from the final implementation.
